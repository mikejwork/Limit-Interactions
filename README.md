## General info

Limit-Interactions provides a system for users to create new interactable game props, and can give a callback to the handler so that their function is called when a player interacts with the specified prop. The project uses Ractive.js to manage the list of interacts on screen, has smooth mouse control to ensure the user does not get stuck.

## Personal Notes
If i was to remake this project i would change from using Ractive.js to use React.js, at the time i chose to use Ractive.js as i did not understand React fully, but now i have a good knowledge in React and could improve the UI considerably.
